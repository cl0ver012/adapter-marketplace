# Project Title: AI Model Fine-Tuning and Marketplace Platform

## Document Date: March 19, 2023

---

## Project Overview
The project is aimed at creating a comprehensive marketplace platform that allows users to fine-tune machine learning models and market them to potential buyers. Additionally, users can upload and sell their pre-trained adapters, facilitating a community-driven approach to model sharing and adaptation. The objective is to connect data scientists, developers, and businesses seeking tailored AI solutions, enabling collaboration and innovation in the AI space. 

---

## Current Progress
We have successfully completed the front-end development of the model fine-tuning interface. Users can now interact with a user-friendly GUI to select models for fine-tuning and initiate the process. The basic framework for user accounts and model listing has also been established.

## Issues and Challenges
One challenge faced is ensuring the scalability of the fine-tuning backend to handle concurrent user requests without significant delays. To address this, we are exploring cloud services with elastic computing capabilities and plan to conduct load testing.

---

## Planned Future Work
The next development phase includes the backend services for model fine-tuning, enabling asynchronous processing of fine-tuning tasks, and user notification upon completion. Furthermore, we'll start the development of the adapter marketplace and associated backend functionalities.
